          <!-- analysis -->
          <p>I began my research with a competitive analysis of three different video game info and tracking apps, analyzing competition to determine the basic direction of my project. I analyzed Game Track, an app I have used myself for info on
            video games; I analyzed Gameye, an app that allows users to keep track of their video game collection by scanning their games or manually adding them; and I analyzed IGN’s native app, as IGN is one of the most well-known sources of video
            game info, reviews and news.</p>

          <h3>Ideation</h3>
          <!-- MVP -->
          <p>After analyzing the market, I determined my Minimum Viable Product (MVP). My MVP helped me cut down on unnecessary features that were better addressed on other apps and focus solely on what I absolutely needed to create. I decided that I
            needed these core features: basic information on video games and the ability to track upcoming games to be notified when they release (a Track/Wishlist feature).

        <!-- Design -->
        <div>
          <h3>Design</h3>
          <!-- Native features -->
          <p>My app was designed to take advantage of as many native features it could. I studied the IOS and Material guidelines for their respective app versions, and I worked with UI kits to make sure everything was as accurate as possible. I
            worked with the dark theme colors because, based on my research, this seems favorable in gaming apps. I used orange as the accent color. I determined that strong branding was not a priority of this app, so I used a native orange color for
            each device to take advantage of the benefits that provides.</p>

    <!-- Wireframe -->
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Wireframe</h2>
      <p>I created low fidelity wireframes, then developed them to mid fidelity wireframes. During this process I developed my app’s visual design. I decided to use a format similar to online shopping, with the “Coming Soon” games made prominent with
        their unique shapes because my app is largely focused on tracking upcoming games.

      </picture>
      <p>As I developed into high fidelity wireframes, I realized some flaws in my design. The main flaw was that I made the games’ images too small, making it hard to see what each game was. I corrected this and proceeded to develop my design.

    <!-- Reflection -->
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>This was my first time using native IOS and Material assets, which was a very interesting experience. While it does make for less creative liberty, I found workin with a more predetermined structure very satisfying and extremely helpful. I
        know not all apps will use as many native features as Game Feed, but creating an app that used almost exclusively native UI elements was a great way to learn about the advantages of using native UI and how to incorporate these features into
        my work.
