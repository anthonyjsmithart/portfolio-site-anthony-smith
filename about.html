          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <p>My name is Anthony Smith. Iâ€™m a 2020 graduate of Ringling College of Art and Design, majoring in Illustration. After graduation, I went on to study UI/UX Design with CareerFoundry.</p>
          <p>At Ringling I trained my illustrative skills and developed my unique style. I created detailed black-and-white illustrations that make heavy use of detailed patters, often with fairy tale stories as their subjects. Though I love
            illustration, it was hard for me to separate my passion from my work, making freelance work very difficult for me. In order to pursue a steadier income, I began working as a Graphic Designer for a souvenir company.</p>
          <p>As a lead souvenir designer, I had to be aware of the market I was designing for, analyzing competition to stay aware of trends. I also became a salesman, taking orders and discussing costs, designs, and shipping dates with my clients.
            Exploring these skills are what convinced me that UI/UX Design would be a much better fit for me. The logical, consumer-centered design mindset and the research that went into every decision allowed me to think of my work as a product
            rather than a personal work of passion, which I had struggled to do as a freelance illustrator. From this point, I began studying UI/UX Design with CareerFoundry, setting my on my career path.</p>
